According to an article published in 'SAPO Notícias Lusa', Portugal is looking to strengthen partnerships with CPLP countries for developing projects aimed at combating drought and desertification. The country has been identified as one of the three most desertified in Europe according to an analysis by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Desert Watch. As a result, the ESA and the Convention for the Fight against Desertification (UNCCD) are working together on a project called DesertWatch to combat desertification. The DesertWatch project focuses on Portugal, Turkey, and Italy, all of which face high levels of desertification. Portugal's government is working to combat desertification by creating policies and establishing projects aimed at drought mitigation and soil conservation. The country is promoting the use of best practices for agriculture, lowering resource consumption, and reducing soil erosion to support its efforts. Through cooperation with other countries facing similar challenges, Portugal aims to find innovative and effective solutions to combat desertification and promote sustainable development.

From year 2014 to year 2017:

Seca em Portugal está a afetar várias das suas áreas, e a situação está a ser monitorizada de perto pelo Instituto Português do Mar e Atmosfera (IPMA). No final de julho de 2017, 79% do território continental português estava a ser afetado por uma seca severa ou extrema. O número deve crescer ainda mais no futuro. Existem várias povoacoes de Bragança sem acesso a água e 15 aldeias estão a ser diariamente abastecidas pelos bombeiros. A idade também pode ser um fator, já que com a idade as glândulas salivares passam a funcionar menos. Os sintomas de fadiga, sede ou dificuldades em focar a vista podem também indicar que existe uma carência de água no organismo. Conseguir beber água suficiente pode reduzir a frequência desses sinais. Por isso, fique atento aos sinais do seu corpo e beba água regularmente.

From year 2017 to year 2020:

The Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA) reports that Portugal experienced a severe and extreme level of drought throughout September and October 2019. At the end of September, 48.4% of mainland Portugal was experiencing moderate drought, 32.7% were experiencing severe drought, 15.4% were experiencing weak drought, and 3.4% were experiencing extreme drought. The drought moderately increased in the Northern and Central regions, while the Southern area experienced a decrease in extreme drought. Portugal previously faced dry spells, but this is the first time that the entire country witnessed severe drought by October. The government has implemented support measures to assist affected regions.

From year 2020 to year 2023:

The Portuguese mainland remained in a meteorological drought situation at the end of September with a slight increase in the area of moderate drought in the northern and central regions. According to the meteorological drought index (PDSI) provided by the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and the Atmosphere (IPMA), 48.4% of Portugal’s territory was in moderate drought at the end of September. In addition, Sado had the highest drought in the last 25 years, and climate change is severely affecting the region. However, the latest drought is not the worst ever recorded, as Portugal experienced a severe drought between 2004 and 2005 and was on the verge of a crisis. Meanwhile, droughts are becoming more severe due to the impact of global warming and climate change.
